# botpress-api.ai
The easiest way to create an API.AI bot with Botpress

## Getting started

```
botpress install api.ai
```

The API.AI module should now be available in your bot UI

## Features
### Multi-Language Agent

You can specify different agents and the languages they supports.  

This module will try to query the agent that support the locale of the user.   
If no agent contains the locale, it will look for the root language (eg: en instead of en-GB) otherwise the default language parameter is used.

For more information see https://api.ai/docs/multi-language

### Mode
This module has two modes: **Default** (amend incoming events) and **Fulfillment** (respond automatically).

#### Default Mode

This mode will inject understanding metadata inside incoming messages through the API.AI middleware.

Events will have an `nlp` property populated with the extracted metadata from API.AI.

**Tip:** Use this mode if you want to handle the conversation flow yourself and only want to extract entities from incoming text. This is great for programmers.

```js
bp.hear({'nlp.action': 'smalltalk.person'}, (event, next) => {
  bp.messenger.sendText(event.user.id, 'My name is James')
})

// to debug nlp during development
// this will hear all responses from dialogflow/api.ai
bp.hear({'nlp.source': 'agent'}, (event, next) => {
  bp.logger.debug('nlp', event.nlp)
})
```

#### Fulfillment Mode

This mode will check if there's an available response in the `fulfillment` property of the API.AI response and respond automatically. No code required.

**Note:** Works only with single-response text. We do not support Cards and quick responses.

**Tip:** This is great for non-programmers or if all your conversation logic is hosted on API.AI.
